# Problem Explanation 🅰️🔠

This program takes a string from the user and converts the **first letter of each word** to uppercase (capital letter), while keeping the rest of the letters as they are.

- The program checks every character in the input:
  - If the character is the first in the string, or comes after a space, it is considered the first letter of a word.
  - That letter is converted to uppercase.
- After processing, the program prints the new string with the first letter of every word in capital.

**Example:**  
If the user enters:  
`hello world from cpp`  
The output will be:  
```
Hello World From Cpp
```
This is useful for formatting names, titles, or sentences to look more organized and professional. ✨📝
